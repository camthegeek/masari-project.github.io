    heading: "About Masari"
    paragraphs:
      line1: "Masari is a privacy-centric innovative cryptocurrency that allows users to send money around the globe with low fees very quickly."
      line2: "Masari ($MSR) is a proof of work peer-to-peer internet currency using the well researched and cryptographically sound <a href='https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf' target='_blank'>CryptoNote</a> and <a href='https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0005.pdf' target='_blank'>RingCT</a> protocols. This means that every transaction origin, amount, and destination is obfuscated by default."
      line3: "Masari is an open source project that is fully decentralized, similar to bitcoin. With several CryptoNote firsts such as uncle mining via the <a href='https://github.com/masari-project/research-corner/blob/master/secor/secor.pdf' target='_blank'>SECOR protocol</a>, a <a href='https://masariwallet.com' target='_blank'>fully client side web wallet</a>, and PoW sharding via the <a href='https://github.com/masari-project/research-corner/blob/master/blocktree/blocktree.pdf' target=''>blocktree protocol</a>, Masari is a fast, fungible, secure, private and soon-to-be scalable currency."
