title: "Simple Extended Consensus Resolution: Uncle Mining On The Blockchain"
abstract: "Since Bitcoin's inception and introduction of cryptocurrency, alternative iterations of permissionless decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash have been developed. However, most of these systems have the same blockchain properties that subsequently retain similar on-chain scalability limitations to Bitcoin. With the introduction of the SECOR protocol, we propose a simple version of Uncle Mining, serving the purpose of faster block emission rates while further securing the network by rewarding miners for otherwise-orphaned blocks, solving in part some of the inherent scalability limitations of blockchain technology. These added properties are achieved by introducing block weight and differentiating it from block difficulty in a hash-based proof-of-work (PoW) system that achieves consensus via the heaviest chain in the network."
