## Description: 

This is a tri-fold business card with space to add a name / alias / memo along with a qr code containing an address. It can be printed and folded to the size of a small business card and used to give to friends or associates so they have your wallet info (and payment ID where needed) for later. 
This is not meant to contain public keys.
