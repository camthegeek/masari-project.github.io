## About the Official Wallets

Here you will find a collection of official Masari wallets. If you would like to add your own wallet to the collection, initiate a pull
request to upload your design to the proper folder. It is also advisable to reach out to community members to field your design before
you initiate a pull request. You can do this by reaching out to people on our official social media channels 
([Twitter](https://twitter.com/masaricurrency), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/masari), [Discord](https://discord.gg/sMCwMqs), [Telegram](https://t.me/masaricurrency), etc).

Here is a guide to [securely creating a wallet](https://github.com/masari-project/Masari-Marketing/blob/master/Tutorials/Paper%20Wallet/paper-wallet-guide.md), which you can then print out onto any style of paper wallet or business card.
