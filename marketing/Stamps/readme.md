## Laws on the Defacement of U.S. currency: 

18 USC 333: [w]hoever mutilates, cuts, defaces, disfigures, or perforates, or unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, or Federal Reserve bank, or the Federal Reserve System, with intent to render such bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt unfit to be reissued, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

18 USC 475: [w]hoever . . . writes, prints, or otherwise impresses upon . . . any [coin or currency] of the United States, any business or professional card, notice, or advertisement, or any notice or advertisement whatever, shall be fined under this title.

## Answer: 

In total, 18 USC 333 is written to prohibit the malicious destruction of currency and 18 USC 475 is written to prevent currency from becoming used for commercial advertising. So long as you use it to express a political message free of any profit motives, you are not breaking any laws as this is protected by the 1st amendment which protects free speech.
