What is Masari?

Masari (MSR) is a scalability-focused, untraceable, secure, and fungible cryptocurrency using the Ring Confidential Transactions Protocol. It is open source and freely available to all. Masari is a truly private digital currency that aims at being simple, scalable, and secure.

Simple

Mobile wallet
Masari’s mobile wallet makes everyday transactions a snap. It connects directly to the blockchain and does not collect any information from the user. It will be pushed to the Google Play Store as well as the Apple App Store. 

Simple Web Wallet
The Simple Web Wallet is a first for the CryptoNote world as it is the first web wallet to connect directly to the blockchain. In doing so, the user maintains complete security and privacy as no user information can be collected. The Simple Web Wallet is also very easy to use and operates much like a Graphical User Interface wallet.

Graphical User Interface Wallet
The GUI wallet was forked from Monero and is available in many different languages. Sending Masari is as simple as clicking a few boxes. 

Simple Miner
The Simple Miner was originally developed to deal with mining centralization problems as it allows for everyday users to experience mining for cryptocurrencies on whatever gadget they own. In just a few clicks, users are able to generate new Masari as well as ensure network stability.

Scalable

Blocktree Sharding
The Blocktree Protocol will be the crowning achievement of the MSR developers, allowing the blockchain to securely shard/partition the blockchain into parallel and synchronized chains within a blocktree. This will allow for theoretically unbound dynamic TPS scale as the blocktree can resize on demand. This is a novel idea that's being investigated in depth by the Masari Project, and a whitepaper (WP) is being worked on to prove out this protocol. Discussion about this protocol can be heard at a Hash It Out podcast with Thaer Khawaja from Masari, and such an idea has been floated before by Howard Chu from Monero. Once the white paper is complete, Masari intends to execute development of it.

Uncle Mining
Uncle Mining is a cryptonote first that rewards miners for work done on abandoned blocks that were not the first to be written to the blockchain. This adds more hashpower (mining power) and 'weight' to the network, making it more secure. This subsequently allows us to significantly speed up our block emission rate for faster confirmations, while further securing the network. Code for this is nearing completion and is being staged for testnet.

Secure

Stable
Masari is especially secure against mining attacks as it necessarily needed to mitigate these adversarial attacks since its early inception. It developed a unique Weighted-weighted Harmonic Mean (WWHM) algorithm that paved the way for a Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA) algorithm. In both scenarios, Masari was first to deploy such algorithms into mainnet, with LWMA being a huge success as modifications were made to securely permit asymmetric adjustments, effectively allowing the network to quickly adjust to changes in the market.

Fungible
Masari is Fungible because it is private be default. Each Masari coin is interchangeable with every other coin no matter what it was spent on. This being the case, you can never be discriminated on for what you spend your Masari on or where you spend it. 

Censorship resistant
Since Masari is private and decentralized, it is free from censorship as nobody will know that you have Masari or that you are spending it. Masari is digital cash, that is, when you spend it, it is just like giving another person physical cash. This means that the transaction is only linkable if you choose for it to be.  

Private
In total, Masari aims at furthering privacy while advancing its own protocol. Whatever Masari develops will be free for public scrutiny as it is open source therefore open to the public for review. In doing so, Masari will push code upstream to Monero as well as make our new privacy features available to the public. In addition, every transaction in the Masari blockchain from the genesis block to now has used the same ringsize. Masari coins are fungible, meaning every coin is interchangeable and indistinguishable from one another. All transaction and address data is hidden using RingCT and Cryptonote protocol. There is no rich list, there is no public record and you are totally anonymous in every way.

History of Masari
Masari was released on September 07, 2017. Masari was announced on BitcoinTalk.org with the stated goal of experimenting novel concepts to Monero’s code base while also contributing back upstream to the parent project. Masari was launched with slight changes that removed Monero’s legacy protocols, enforced a static mixin of 12, randomized transaction fee sources, and fluffy blocks were being enabled by default. Later, Masari implemented the Weighted Harmonic Mean WHM algorithm. Soon after, Masari ported Monero's GUI Wallet, merged the latest changes from Monero’s v0.12.0 such as subaddresses, multisig, and a PoW change. Masari found the PoW change to be problematic for mining and created its own unique algorithm CryptoNight-Fast. Masari will soon add a uncle mining and blocktree sharding which should allow for a more stable network and a higher number of transactions. The lead developer, Thaer, has also stated the goal of Ledger integration in the near future.

The Masari Difference

Masari Research Corner		
Masari is focused on furthering privacy to the CryptoNote protocol. This being the case, Masari has launched the Masari Research Corner to further privacy in the cryptospace. 

Active Development
Masari is actively developed by 3 core members: Thaer, Cryptochangements, and Gnock. Together they work to maintain the network by adding any necessary upgrades if any threats arise. In addition, two other core members, LodoCrypto and BazookaJeff spearhead marketing and communication efforts. 
Development Milestones Already Achieved
CryptoNight-Fast is a new algorithm created by the Masari team 
Weighted-Weighted Harmonic Mean difficulty adjustment algorithm making Masari ASIC resistant and more resilient against mining attacks like flash mining
Both algorithms have been adopted by several small Cryptonote coins. Masari is a leader, not a follower in this space.
The DAA has been submitted to Monero to be adopted pending review
Client-side web wallet
Android mobile wallet (IOS coming soon)
GUI and CLI desktop wallets for Windows and Mac, CLI desktop wallet for Linux

Fair Distribution
No ICO
0.5% premine set aside  for development
There are no masternodes or other incentives to concentrate the supply among a small number of people
Strong Development: Masari is developed by one full-time core member, Thaer Khawaja, and two part-timer developers, Gnock and Cryptochangements

How Will People Use Masari?
Remittances
Uses of Masari could include remittances and tipping as the Masari network is global and is not bound by a single government or entity.
Store of Wealth
Because Masari is fungible it can be used as a currency and as a store of wealth as your money is free from malevolent agents.
General Payments
Masari is just like cash. This being the case, users can just use Masari if they do not want to accept cash or have their operations solely online and simply cannot accept cash.
