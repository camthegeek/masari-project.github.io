#### What is Masari?

Masari (MSR) is a scalability-focused, untraceable, secure, and fungible cryptocurrency using the RingCT protocol.

Masari is:

private by default—no person, institution, or government can censure you. 

free from any centralized controls as it relies on a decentalized world wide network. 

more private than bitcoin since it does not record your transactions on a public ledger. 

freely accessible and available to all as it is open source and transparent. 

Please take a moment to learn more about the importance of privacy and The Masari Project.

# Back

Masari is a special type of digital money that you can use on the internet. Unlike Bitcoin, Masari is private. This means that you can purchase things on the internet without being discriminated on for what your buy and or how rich you are. Masari has no central authority. This means that it is decentralized and immune to censorship or simply put that it can’t be shut down. Masari aims to be simple, scalable, and secure.

#### Simple

Simple is achieved by our creation of our fully-clientside web wallet that is trustless. You simply login to masariwallet.com and make your new wallet. It connects directly to the blockchain and so nobody can peek  at your information. Masari also has a special graphical userface wallet like an app or a command line wallet if you’re into that sort of thing. We will even have a mobile wallet but it is still in development. 

#### Scalable

Scalable is achieved by our new scaling feature that will use a new technology called blocktree sharding.  Blocktree sharding will take advantage of one-time public outputs to partition/shard the transactions into a scalable blocktree. This means that the network won’t be slowed down by lots of transactions and regular stores can use Masari just like VISA cards. 

#### Secure

Secure is achieved by our implementation of Uncle mining using DECOR+. It will be added in the near future to ensure more network security and for safely reducing block emission rates for better network latency. In addition, Masari has implemented our first-of-its-kind Proof of Work, called CryptoNight-Fast, to secure against network attacks, foster stability, and make mining more egalitarian. Furthermore, in order to stop problems like flash mining, Masari uses an effective DAA. This WWHM/LWMA algorithm also took into consideration our parent project Monero by submitting a pull request back upstream. 

#### Private

Masari uses ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses to hide the sources, amounts, and destinations of all transactions. Transactions on the Masari blockchain cannot be linked to any users. No coins can ever become “tainted” like Bitcoin. 
In total, Masari aims to be one of the top privacy coins in the cryptosphere.
