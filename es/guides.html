<p>This educational activity is designed to show the new user how to use the CLI Wallet. It is based off of v0.3 but will be very similar to future versions.</p>

<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>

<p>Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you extracted the download of the CLI wallet into, in this case it’s</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">cd /home/fire/masari-linux-x64-v0.3.0.0</code></p>

<p>and start the daemon with <code class="highlighter-rouge">./masarid</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/synced.png" alt="synced" /></p>

<p>After the daemon is synced, open a new terminal tab with Ctrl + Shift + t. Start the CLI wallet with:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">./masari-wallet-cli</code></p>

<p>Create a new wallet by entering any name for the wallet. Then input a password and choose your language. Make sure to copy down
and keep your 25 word seed safe- with just those 25 words you can access and restore the entire wallet, including spending all
the funds on it. Now you’re ready to begin.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/create_new_wallet.png" alt="A new wallet" /></p>

<p>The general structure of a wallet is:</p>

<h4 id="wallet--account--address">wallet &gt; account &gt; address</h4>

<p>meaning that a wallet can contain many accounts and each account can contain many addresses. The wallet starts out with one account with one address on it. Let’s make more.</p>

<p>First, a new account within our wallet:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">account new garage sale income</code></p>

<p>This will make a new account with the label “garage sale income”. Notice that white spaces are allowed in the new account name.
Let’s add another account for “everyday cash”:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">account new everyday cash</code></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/new_accts.png" alt="New accounts" /></p>

<p>As you can see, we now have 3 accounts indexed 0,1, and 2. To switch between accounts, use:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">account switch &lt;index&gt;</code></p>

<p>Let’s say someone wants to buy the TV at our garage sale. We should switch to account 1- garage sale income, and create 
a new address to receive the funds. Let’s add the label “old TV”, so we can remember the source of the income when tax season 
inevitably rolls around.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">account switch 1</code></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">address new old TV</code></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/new_add_oldTV.png" alt="Address for TV money" /></p>

<p>Now we can give this new address 9pDUb…43yY to the customer. The price for the old TV is 2 MSR. When we want to verify that
the customer has paid, we can switch to the relevant account and use:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">address all</code></p>

<p>to show all addresses within that account and whether or not they have been used. To check balance, simply type:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">balance</code></p>

<p>To see specifically which address received the funds, we can use:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">show_transfers in</code></p>

<p>where we see (in order) block height, transaction in or out, time, amount, txid, payment id, and index. The index 1
corresponds to our generated address “old TV” at index 1, so we know the TV is paid for. When the transaction comes in (or is
checked with <code class="highlighter-rouge">show_transfers in</code>) it specifies exactly where in the wallet the funds were sent to, in this case (in green) it says “idx 1/1” which means that the funds arrived to the account at index 1 (garage sale income), address at index 1 (old TV). For the sake of privacy, we won’t reuse this address.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/payment_receive_index1.png" alt="Got the TV money!" /></p>

<h3 id="importing-a-wallet">Importing a wallet</h3>

<p>If you have previously generated a wallet (from <a href="https://getmasari.org/masari-wallet-generator.html">an offline wallet generator</a> for example) and want to import it using the command line interface (CLI), you can use the following tools
in a new terminal window:</p>

<ul>
  <li>import with view key</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">./masari-wallet-cli --generate-from-view-key &lt;wallet name&gt;</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>import with spend key</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">./masari-wallet-cli --generate-from-spend-key &lt;wallet name&gt;</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>import with 25 word mnemonic phrase</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">./masari-wallet-cli --restore-deterministic-wallet</code></p>

<p>Importing with the view key will generate a <em>view-only</em> wallet, which we can not spend from. A view-only wallet also does not
show transactions <strong>out</strong>, but only transactions <strong>in</strong>. For that reason, the balance reflected in a view-only wallet may be
inaccurate, since any transactions out have not been substracted from the balance.</p>

<p>Importing a wallet via spend key or mnemonic phrase will give us full access to the wallet, including the ability to spend the
funds on that wallet. This is why spend key and mnemonic phrase must be kept secure at all times!</p>

<h3 id="sending">Sending</h3>

<p>Now say we want to send 1 MSR to a friend. After we open the wallet and select the account we want to send from, we can
use the transfer command. The most general transfer command is:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">transfer &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</code></p>

<p>Sending 1 MSR to the address our friend gave us would then look like this:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">transfer 9jNEbBf4eUUeNvKEJVpeqGa86iavuJzhAV35REsYNh7KEHrFrHFJAMJiA1PPdLZdAvDAN7ps4Jn6iLfobCmMyT9pV17nrRi 1</code></p>

<p>If you use a payment ID, it should be inserted after the amount. Using a new address for each transaction is recommended, though.
If you want to reuse addresses and send multiple transactions to the same address, you can use the address book function.</p>

<h3 id="address-book">Address book</h3>

<p>To add an entry (white spaces are allowed in description):</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">address_book add &lt;address&gt; &lt;description&gt;</code></p>

<p>To show all entries in your address book, use:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">address_book</code></p>

<p>And to delete an entry, use:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">address_book delete &lt;index&gt;</code></p>

<p>All of these commands will show your address book after executing.</p>

<h3 id="proving-sending">Proving sending</h3>

<p>You will need 3 things to prove that you sent funds: txid, tx key, and the wallet address you sent to. In this case we sent
to the address
9jNEbBf4eUUeNvKEJVpeqGa86iavuJzhAV35REsYNh7KEHrFrHFJAMJiA1PPdLZdAvDAN7ps4Jn6iLfobCmMyT9pV17nrRi
which can be verified when we get the txid and show the transfers out. We do that with:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">show_transfers out</code></p>

<p>The txid is the string after the date and amount sent. In this case it’s</p>

<p>13f7529685020eb3e69b401acc81968f90fe30024492f7b599053bf2ec269188</p>

<p>Save this for step 3. Notice that the destination address displayed here.</p>

<p>Next, get the tx key with:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">get_tx_key &lt;txid&gt;</code></p>

<p>In this case it’s</p>

<p>e8b96020ae99162c0d87d35d5d96e960e573189cefea634660c0cb1f01a6d905</p>

<p>Save this for step 3.</p>

<p>Finally, step 3. Check the tx key with the tx ID, tx key, and the address you sent to:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">check_tx_key &lt;txid&gt; &lt;txkey&gt; &lt;address&gt;</code></p>

<p>Possible outcomes are:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;address&gt; received &lt;amount&gt; in txid &lt;txid&gt;</code></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Error: &lt;address&gt; received nothing in txid &lt;txid&gt;</code></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/prove_sending.png" alt="Prove sending" /></p>

<h3 id="using-the-block-explorer">Using the block explorer</h3>

<p>The block explorer at <a href="https://explorer.getmasari.org">https://explorer.getmasari.org</a> can be used to decode outputs (check if you have money coming in to an
address) and prove sending (prove that you sent money out to an address). You’ll need to get some info from your CLI 
wallet first, though. To decode outputs, you’ll need the address where you’re expecting funds (which you can get to by 
doing <code class="highlighter-rouge">address</code> in the corresponding account) and the private viewkey. Doing</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">viewkey</code></p>

<p>will return your private viewkey and your public viewkey. Each wallet has 1 set of viewkeys, so it’s the same for all 
your accounts and addresses within the same wallet.</p>

<p>Proving sending is a bit more tricky. You also need 2 pieces of info here- the recipient’s address, and the tx private key
that was generated by your wallet when you sent that transaction. Use the method outlined above in “Proving sending” to get
the information needed, then simply copy and paste the info into the block explorer.</p>

<h3 id="signing-and-verifying">Signing and verifying</h3>

<p>Since cryptocurrencies are founded on cryptography, we can do some pretty neat things with the CLI wallet, like
sign and verify files. Let’s make a text file with a message, say message.txt, and sign it with:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sign &lt;file_to_sign&gt;</code></p>

<p>for example:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sign /home/me/Desktop/message.txt</code></p>

<p>This will print out a signature. You need to give that signature and your wallet address (along with the file in question, of
course) to the other party to verify the file with the verify command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">verify &lt;filename&gt; &lt;address&gt; &lt;signature&gt;</code></p>

<p>They can verify that the file has not been tampered with by doing:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">verify /home/my_friend/Downloads/message.txt &lt;my address&gt; &lt;signature from previous step&gt;</code></p>

<p>The two possible outcomes are:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Good signature from &lt;address&gt;</code></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Error: Bad signature from &lt;address&gt;</code></p>

<h3 id="multisig-wallet">Multisig wallet</h3>

<p><strong>Warning: It’s best to start this process with a new wallet. Making a wallet that’s in use into a multisig wallet will cause all the wallet’s existing funds to be subject to the multisig wallet requirements.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s make a 2/3 multisig wallet- meaning a wallet that is shared between 3 parties and requires the signature of 2 of the
parties in order to send a transaction. After generating a new wallet (or 3 in the case of this tutorial example) we start 
by doing:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">prepare_multisig</code></p>

<p>The output will be:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">[wallet 5nsmk1]: prepare_multisig
Wallet password: 
MultisigV1cwjWztsW58NCXeWLBJm9oBawvQGGSTrcvhEo9diSuZQ8FSiGVPqLT3DbHeYKBTkyGjfbWqzpViuXwDPFvsL5RVdUbw1E5W9Tuc9XmWSS8dTySm2HPfaoyjBNi88AzP8DJQP5VV4CaVhxzAJgiGNpyC8ChJgXL4mPFWqyLb8FdUxeY2WC
Send this multisig info to all other participants, then use make_multisig &lt;threshold&gt; &lt;info1&gt; [&lt;info2&gt;...] with others' multisig info
This includes the PRIVATE view key, so needs to be disclosed only to that multisig wallet's participants</code></p>

<p>All parties involved need to run this command and share their respective output line (MultisigV1cs…Y2WC in our case) with all other parties, so make sure to save that output line somewhere for easy access.</p>

<p>Let’s say that our 2 friends gave us their multisig info as follows:</p>

<p>MultisigV1D9uKCS3sYKzWGgDA5nieEg7WwQDXpAPEgWWp83dDvQnJC51aFzcKLXWVPrAjX7PfspgvxXZGLU7bTgBSiawsXpCZfVW5GfrWcwdVHQypWQt1Nv4NhYUiDtGReVoXMoPJQGcK6TYR3NNWTMNDZDCB8sCK9jSv5tbpXF9bi7NVWXSB392S</p>

<p>MultisigV16fa4JTwXSaLi8NUVfaXhu1Rid6zt8MsYNGgYwbhLAj5e2rVwH7gR7rMjo898PvqtoBbYbDg96W2EV7kTv7xiAU5X3b4mQ1AGJbn3GeohBPd8334EWRaMN7vqnPQeYMgzNqGc1awtuX8WF5AEwTNyu8EAAsHgD6k5re7nXVc2muonKuQU</p>

<p>Now we do make_multisig &lt;# of signatures needed to send funds&gt; &lt;friends’ multisig info&gt;</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">make_multisig 2 MultisigV1D9uKCS3sYKzWGgDA5nieEg7WwQDXpAPEgWWp83dDvQnJC51aFzcKLXWVPrAjX7PfspgvxXZGLU7bTgBSiawsXpCZfVW5GfrWcwdVHQypWQt1Nv4NhYUiDtGReVoXMoPJQGcK6TYR3NNWTMNDZDCB8sCK9jSv5tbpXF9bi7NVWXSB392S MultisigV16fa4JTwXSaLi8NUVfaXhu1Rid6zt8MsYNGgYwbhLAj5e2rVwH7gR7rMjo898PvqtoBbYbDg96W2EV7kTv7xiAU5X3b4mQ1AGJbn3GeohBPd8334EWRaMN7vqnPQeYMgzNqGc1awtuX8WF5AEwTNyu8EAAsHgD6k5re7nXVc2muonKuQU</code></p>

<p>Note that there’s a space between the 2 strings of multisig info from our friends, and we do not include our own multisig info in this command. The output will be something like:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Another step is needed
MultisigxV1RyEDEvH47sE2vmWE9xUpHRdYdxQcdXHR5UJbhQkKr8M8YrU29mR3BBTL1S8fiFVpfSSVXuSVzfPJ9FYBbsdqU3A2cgWNdKU19WPgggPp12hAnBiSkL3q1wUmMi365HfqZbZ4DSjawWJFVDkcQdgsYJY2LJhxe5dQhLccujb3rLkXL62ZE7nF9C5rXJ3HH54QJsyWA3G25ckc9re5WLehexiQbgby
Send this multisig info to all other participants, then use finalize_multisig &lt;info1&gt; [&lt;info2&gt;...] with others' multisig info</code></p>

<p>This is telling us to do almost the exact same thing one more time. Each person does <code class="highlighter-rouge">finalize_multisig</code> with the output line 
of the other 2 friends. Our output line was [MultisigxV1RyED…LehexiQbgby] and our friends gave us the output lines
[MultisigxV1DJKkCJA…EgxprmCAiV] and [MultisigxV1NeWAJK…fkvkcn4], so for this example:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">finalize_multisig MultisigxV1DJKkCJAaVw7BTnAQuMpHSe3xVgRoQtp4d6ty7nbiissBYrU29mR3BBTL1S8fiFVpfSSVXuSVzfPJ9FYBbsdqU3A2aabVeFzGHHdPwGEudRHKp3QiirG6sZbduaWNo3mxec7HAVSqcsCKynTSgQgwDXYQ8wevq8tPcag5ABMKpy7yojYgc94tsn4rc3vDyrx5JoZH5VjFqvBGKNWW59EgxprmCAiV MultisigxV1NeWAJKop7e7DMnUSQJzMKVHMzU4PDNajV6MpMkmz4e9wcgWNdKU19WPgggPp12hAnBiSkL3q1wUmMi365HfqZbZ4aabVeFzGHHdPwGEudRHKp3QiirG6sZbduaWNo3mxec7H9yZ51cgZhpYVoTbVWNMTLHHg15tBTQZHMgDPruqBbHV265T2UjJX7qwA5G1bpr6ZUtPU8c3D613HWcqB6fkvkcn4</code></p>

<p>Remember to put a space between the sets of multisig info. There should be no output, but you will notice that the wallet address has changed.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/finalize_multisig1.png" alt="finalize_multisig" /></p>

<p>Your new, multisig wallet address can be found by doing</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">address</code></p>

<p>and you will notice that now all 3 parties have the same wallet address:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/3xaddress.png" alt="3xaddress" /></p>

<h3 id="spending-from-multisig">Spending from multisig</h3>

<p>After our multisig wallet has some funds on it, let’s spend them. First we need to exchange multisig info with our friends. Since this is a 2/3 multisig wallet, we need the info from 1 friend to complete a transaction. Alternatively, we could get the info from both friends and decide later which info to sign with. First we’ll <strong>export</strong> our multisig info by using the command export_multisig_info and any file name, like:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">export_multisig_info multis1</code></p>

<p>The exported file will be in the same folder as your wallets, in this case /home/fire/masari-linux-x64-v0.3.0.0. We need to send this to our 2 friends so they can sign a transaction, and they need to send their exported multisig info to us.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/multis1.png" alt="multis1" /></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/multis2.png" alt="multis2" /></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/multis3.jpg" alt="multis3" /></p>

<p>Now we’ll <strong>import</strong> our friends’ multisig info files. By default, the wallet will look in the shell working folder for the files (that was /home/fire/masari-linux-x64-v0.3.0.0 in this case, but can vary if you have an advanced setup), so make sure the files are there. The file “multis 2” should be in friend #2’s wallet folder since he exported it there, same for “multis 3”. After we have all 3 multisig info files, we use the import_multisig_info command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">import_multisig_info multis2 multis3</code></p>

<p>The output will tell us the balance our multisig wallet has to work with, and that multisig info was imported. See the photo
below for reference.</p>

<p>Now let’s spend!</p>

<p>Any of the 3 friends can start the transaction, and will need to get the signature from 1 of the other 2 friends. Start the transaction as usual</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">transfer 5qF9rxMbxBH4mEXBs1SE1taMDrkEoVzGX4ycwBhNCiVqPMc5yEKoEqN4TLavJcdLMJGyQgawFTKbu5QTHFLVQWsWTbFTkX6 1</code></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/transfer.png" alt="transfer" /></p>

<p>This will generate a file called multisig_masari_tx. For peace of mind, let’s do one transaction at a time. Let’s choose friend #2 to complete the signature for this transaction. If we choose a friend that we did <em>not</em> import the multisig file info from, we will get the error</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Error: Failed to sign multisig transaction: Final signed transaction not found: this transaction was likely made without our export data, so we cannot sign it</code></p>

<p>Also, our friend needs to have our file multisig_masari_tx in his shell working folder (which means we have to send it) and then
they can use sign_multisig with the file multisig_masari_tx:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sign_multisig multisig_masari_tx</code></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/sign_multisig_right1.png" alt="sign" /></p>

<p>After verifying the address, amount, fees, ring size, and change address, our friend will press <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> and the transaction will be successfully signed to the file multisig_masari_tx. Now the transaction is ready to be relayed to the network. Our friend can
send the file back to us or broadcast it himself by doing:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">submit_multisig multisig_masari_tx</code></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Satori-Nakamoto/simplewallet-guide/master/tx_success.png" alt="submit" /></p>

<p>Congratulations, transaction successfully submitted!</p>

<p>To recap, the sending process went like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>At least 2 friends <code class="highlighter-rouge">export_multisig_info</code> and share their file with the other one (or both).</li>
  <li>The other friend (or both) uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">import_multisig_info</code> with at least 1 other multisig info file.</li>
  <li>Any of the friends with imported multisig info can start the transaction using the normal <code class="highlighter-rouge">transfer</code> command and generate a file called “multisig_masari_tx”, which should be sent to at least 1 other friend for signing.</li>
  <li>At least 1 of the <em>other</em> 2 friends needs to sign this file by doing <code class="highlighter-rouge">sign_multisig multisig_masari_tx</code>on the file</li>
  <li>The signed file is submitted to the network with <code class="highlighter-rouge">submit_multisig multisig_masari_tx</code></li>
</ol>

<p>If the friends want to send another transaction, they should go back to step 1 and start the process again. If you don’t 
delete the file multisig_masari_tx it will just be overwritten next time a multisig transaction is created.</p>

<h3 id="other-basic-commands">Other basic commands</h3>

<p>To send to multiple addresses in the same transaction, use:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">transfer &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount&gt; &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount&gt; &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount&gt; &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</code></p>

<p>To send <strong>all</strong> the money from an address, use</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sweep_all &lt;destination address&gt;</code></p>

<p>Remember that if you want to sweep everything away from the <em>entire wallet</em> you will have to go through each <em>account</em> and do
sweep_all for each <em>address</em>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">sweep_all</code> function starts with the highest index address and goes down to the address
at index 0. To check that you got all the coin out of the wallet, simply do</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">account</code></p>

<p>and it will show you each account with it’s corresponding balance.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">bc_height</code> prints the block chain height</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">encrypted_seed</code> gives you the option to encrypt your seed words with a password of your choosing, and then displays it, while</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">seed</code> simply displays your seed words</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">donate &lt;amount&gt;</code> is the easy way to make a donation to the development fund</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">fee</code> shows the current tx fee per kb, as well as any backlogs in the mempool</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">payment_id</code> is used to generate a random payment ID, useful for knowing who a specific payment came from</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">wallet_info</code> displays basic info about your wallet, like name and address</p>

							<h1 id="how-to-generate-a-paper-wallet">How to Generate a Paper Wallet</h1>

<p>This educational activity is designed to show the new user how to securely store Masari in cold storage (also known as a paper wallet).</p>

<h3 id="what-is-cold-storage">What is cold storage?</h3>

<p>Cold storage refers to a wallet which resides offline, disconnected from the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="why-should-i-use-cold-storage">Why should I use cold storage?</h3>

<p>If you hold a large amount of Masari with no plans to spend anytime soon, cold storage can help you secure that value against attackers.</p>

<h3 id="what-methods-are-there-to-create-cold-wallets">What methods are there to create cold wallets?</h3>

<p>Creating a cold wallet can be completed in a variety of ways, each providing different security levels. In this guide we will focus on two:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Simply disconnecting from the Internet and running the masari-wallet-generator on your every-day hot computer (least secure).</li>
  <li>Creating a bootable USB stick with any Linux distro, disconnecting from the internet, booting from the USB stick, running the generator, and destroying the USB stick afterwards (more secure).</li>
</ol>

<p>For most users, option 1 will suffice and your Masari will be fairly secure. However, if you generate a wallet while your computer is infected, you risk losing your funds. Option 2 is a more secure option for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are generating on an OS that you know is clean (non-infected).</li>
  <li>Assuming you wipe (or even better, destroy) the USB afterwards, that OS and cold wallet data will never be able to hit the Internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>This, however, doesnt prevent any hardware based attacks such as <a href="https://ds9a.nl/articles/posts/spectre-meltdown/">Spectre and Meltdown</a>, since you are using the same computer hardware on the hot OS. Additional precautions can be made such as buying a new computer which has never touched the Internet or using an old computer without Internet connection. You could then save the masari-wallet-generator utility on an Internet-connected computer to an USB drive and use it on the aforementioned computer. This method will not be covered.</p>

<p>It should go without saying, but it is up to <strong>you</strong> to determine threat model and use whatever option fits your needs.</p>

<p>You can download community made <a href="https://github.com/masari-project/Masari-Marketing/tree/master/Paper%20Wallets">printable paper wallets</a> to write down important information in style.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-cold-wallet-using-a-hot-computer-least-secure">Creating A Cold Wallet Using a Hot Computer (least secure)</h3>

<p><strong>Skill Required</strong></p>

<p>This option requires a moderate understanding of Masari and little computer knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware and Software Required</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>1x Hot computer</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Optional - 1x USB drive</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>1x Paper</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>1x Pen</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>1x Hash Utility</em>.  Most users utilize the built in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil#BKMK_hashfile">Windows 10 utility</a> or <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToSHA256SUM">Ubuntu utility</a>. An easy to use and well known GUI utility is <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/quickhash/">QuickHash</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Downloading and Preparation</strong></p>

<p>On your computer, navigate to <a href="https://github.com/masari-project/masari-wallet-generator">https://github.com/masari-project/masari-wallet-generator</a> and download the zip file by clicking the green box labeled “Clone or download” and then “Download ZIP”.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/Paper-Wallet/Images/download.PNG" alt="download" /></p>

<p>Unplug or disable internet access.</p>

<p>It is recommended to check that the sha256 hash of the downloaded zip file matches the following: <code class="highlighter-rouge">8897902B264D143EBC4705B9D787676C2425A68255397C359B6E2B8CCF78966A</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Generating a New Wallet</strong></p>

<p>Unzip the file and open <code class="highlighter-rouge">masari-wallet-generator.html</code>.</p>

<p>Click “GENERATE WALLET”.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/Paper-Wallet/Images/generate.png" alt="generate" /></p>

<p><strong>Mnemonic Seed and Address</strong></p>

<p>After generating the wallet, four important items will be shown:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Public address - Used to recieve funds.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/Paper-Wallet/Images/public%20address.png" alt="public address" /></li>
  <li>Mnemonic seed - A method of storing the entire wallet that is easily recognizable to humans. This is all you need to restore your wallet at a later date.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/Paper-Wallet/Images/mnemonic%20seed.png" alt="mnemonic seed" /></li>
  <li>Private spend key and view key - There for information only, since they can be recovered from the mnemonic seed. Commonly, the view key is used to setup a view-only wallet on a hot computer which can see incoming transactions as they are sent to your cold wallet.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/Paper-Wallet/Images/private%20keys.png" alt="private keys" /></li>
</ul>

<p>Somewhere by your choosing, write down your <em>public address</em> and <em>mnemonic seed</em>. Make sure to keep a copy (or multiple copies) at all times in a secure place, as your wallet cannot be recovered if you lose your mnemonic seed. Also, never share this information with anyone except trusted parties.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can copy/paste (do not type) your <em>public address</em> and <em>private view key</em> to a text file and save on a separate USB stick.  This can be used to more easily create a view only wallet later with relative abandon.  The only consequence being, if someone gets a hold of your address and private view key, they could view the funds in your wallet.  They would not be able to, however, spend any funds.</p>

<p><strong>Clean Up</strong></p>

<p>Delete any copy of the wallet generator left over on the device you used.</p>

<p>Restart your computer.</p>

<p>Reconnect to the internet.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have sucessfully generated a paper wallet.</p>

<p>This educational activity is designed to show the new user how to use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) Wallet.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-new-wallet">Creating a New Wallet</h3>

<p><strong>Downloading</strong></p>

<p>To start, you will need to download the official Masari wallet from getmasari.org. You may pick from any operating system but be sure to select the GUI wallet and not the CLI wallet.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/GUI-Wallet/images/downloads.PNG" alt="downloads" /></p>

<p>Checking the sha256 hash (correct hash is listed) is recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Open the Masari Wallet</strong></p>

<p>Once you have downloaded the Masari GUI wallet, unzip the file and double click <code class="highlighter-rouge">masari-wallet-gui</code> to open. The GUI will prompt you to select a language. To select a language, simply double click your country’s flag.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/GUI-Wallet/images/language.jpg" alt="language" /></p>

<p><strong>Setting Up Your Wallet</strong></p>

<p>Once you have picked your language, you can create a new wallet by clicking ‘Create a new wallet’.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/GUI-Wallet/images/create%20wallet.jpg" alt="create wallet" /></p>

<p>When you click this icon, you will be given a mnemonic seed. This list of words is what is used to restore your wallet if you ever lose it or forget the password. Make sure to keep a copy (or multiple copies) at all times in a secure place, as your wallet cannot be recovered if you lose it. Also, never share this information with anyone except trusted parties.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing a Password</strong></p>

<p>After writing down your mnemonic seed, you will be prompted to choose a password for your wallet.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/GUI-Wallet/images/password.jpg" alt="password" /></p>

<p>It is advisable to pick a password that is complex, as you could lose your funds if a malevolent person logs into your wallet.</p>

<p><strong>Daemon Settings</strong></p>

<p>When you have chosen your password, the wallet will then ask you what kind of Daemon settings you wish to have. The easiest way for your wallet to connect to the blockchain is by selecting the default status of ‘start a node automatically in the background’.</p>

<p>It may take a while for you to synchronize with the network with this selection and your computer may slow. This is normal and you have no need to worry. Faster computers will generally not slow down as much.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have created a Masari wallet using the GUI!</p>

<h3 id="using-the-masari-gui-wallet">Using the Masari GUI Wallet</h3>

<p>The GUI wallet is designed to give you the simplest PC experience using Masari. This being the case, sending and receiving Masari is a snap!</p>

<p><strong>Synchronizing</strong></p>

<p>The first thing you must do when using your wallet is wait for the daemon to synchronize to the network. The wallet will begin syncing automatically after opening the wallet (assuming you chose start a node in the background). You can see progress in the bottom left of the wallet. When you are synchronized, the daemon will inform you that you may now use Masari.</p>

<p><strong>Sending</strong></p>

<p>To send funds, click the ‘Send’ tab on the left sidebar, then enter the amount of Masari you wish to send in the ‘Amount’ field and the address in the ‘Address’ field.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/GUI-Wallet/images/send.jpg" alt="send" /></p>

<p>In some cases you may be required to enter in a payment ID to send your funds successfully. This feature is mostly relegated to some exchanges.</p>

<p>For most transactions, keep the ‘Transaction Priority’ as the default.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Funds</strong></p>

<p>To receive funds, click on the ‘Receive’ tab on the left sidebar. When you do this, you will see an address that starts with a 5.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/GUI-Wallet/images/recieve.jpg" alt="recieve" /></p>

<p>You can click the clipboard on the right of the address to automatically copy the address to your computer’s clipboard. Alternatively, the QR code on this screen is a visual representation of your address, copy it to signs and cards to receive funds in your physical store.</p>

<p><strong>Looking at Your History</strong></p>

<p>If you want to see your transaction history, all you need to do is click on the ‘History’ tab on the sidebar. From there, you will be able to see a history of all of your purchases and notes.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/GUI-Wallet/images/history.jpg" alt="history" /></p>

<p>Here you will also be able to see any notes you have added to each transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Checking Your Seed</strong></p>

<p>You can view your mnemonic seed again by clicking the ‘Settings’ tab and selecting ‘Seed &amp; Keys’. When you do this, you will be prompted to type your password again. From there, you will be able to see your mnemonic seed as well as your secret keys.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeuTheIdit/Masari-Marketing/master/Tutorials/GUI-Wallet/images/checking%20seed.jpg" alt="checking seed" /></p>

<p>Again, do not share this information with anybody except with trusted parties.</p>

<p>You may also export a view only wallet at the bottom of the page.</p>
